# Intro Hi, it's cool that you're taking a look at my configs and such.
It's not a framework or anything and I've been stripping down the
dependencies
 so that the configs stay as small as possible.

# `bins/`

I've written and accumulated a lot of scripts which help me with my
day-to-day tasks. Some are quite useful (`git-` extensions), some
are somewhat-useful (`fcrypt`) and some are just ridiculous (`faces`,
`imgcat`)

# Supported OS

I use these on both Linux and OSX so I make sure they work everywhere.
My terminal emulator of choice is iTerm2 (nightlies) with Tomorrow-Night
theme.

# The Setup

### You'll need this:

- git
- make

### How To

    cd ~
    git clone git@github.com:lukaszkorecki/DotFiles.git .DotFiles # it HAS to be .DotFiles
    cd .DotFiles
    make setup


#### Tools

Here's a list of tools I can't work without:

- tmux (latest)
- Bash (4.1+)
- git

#### Editors

I constantly switch between:

- Emacs24 + evil-mode - configs are [in cult-leader repo](https://github.com/lukaszkorecki/cult-leader)
- Vim - configs are in [DotVim repo](https://github.com/lukaszkorecki/DotVim)


#### Programming languages I use

- Ruby
- Shell
- Go
- Python
