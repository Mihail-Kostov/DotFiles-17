Hi, it's cool that you're taking a look at my configs and such.
It's not a framework or anything and I've been stripping down the dependencies (for example oh-my-zsh, vim plugins and others) so that the configs stay as small as possible.

If you want to use them though....

### You'll need this:

- git
- ruby (min 1.8.7)

### dotFiles are focused on these tools:

- vim 7.3 (7.1 is probably fine)
- tmux
- rake
- zsh


### How to setup (once you got the stuff above)

    cd ~
    git clone git@github.com:lukaszkorecki/DotFiles.git .DotFiles
    cd .DotFiles
    rake setup



### Optional stuff  but really cool to have (and use)

- ctags (latest svn)
- mcabber
- pry
- spotify
- tmuxinator
- mcabber
- coffeetags


I also play with:

- Chicken Scheme
- Clojure
- Python


so you'll probably find some things relating to them.
