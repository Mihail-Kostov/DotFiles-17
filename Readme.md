Hi, it's cool that you're taking a look at my configs and such.
It's not a framework or anything and I've been stripping down the dependencies (for example oh-my-zsh, rake, vim plugins and others) so that the configs stay as small as possible.

If you want to use them though....

### You'll need this:

- git
- make

Here's a list of tools I can't work without:

- vim 7.3 (>7.1  is probably fine)
- tmux (latest)
- zsh (latest)

Programming languages I use on daily basis:

- Ruby
- Javascript / CoffeeScript
- Shell (bash/zsh)


### How to setup (once you got the stuff above)

    cd ~
    git clone git@github.com:lukaszkorecki/DotFiles.git .DotFiles # it HAS to be .DotFiles
    cd .DotFiles
    make setup

### Optional stuff but really cool to have (and use)

- mutt
- ctags (latest svn)
- weechat
- pry
- coffeetags

I also play with:

- Chicken Scheme
- Clojure
- Python
- Node.js

so you'll probably find some things related to them.
